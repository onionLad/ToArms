# To Arms!
A 2D medieval strategy RPG set in the fantasy world of Elduin, inspired by Fire Emblem and Mount & Blade.

## Progress
As of right now, the game allows the player to move units around on a grid field. Units cannot move into each other's spaces. I intend on implementing a feature that allows the player to only move one unit at a time. I'm currently working on the combat system.
