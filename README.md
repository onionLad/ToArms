# To Arms!
A 2D medieval strategy RPG set in the fantasy world of Elduin, inspired by Fire Emblem and Mount & Blade.

## Status

### Current Status
As of right now, the game is able to form a turn order and allows the player to move units on their turn. Additionally, units can now attack each other.

### In Progress
As of right now, I am working on a way for the game to display unit information during a unit's turn. There is currently a bug that causes units to take damage from attacks that didn't target them. Additionally, defeated units aren't getting removed from the turn order.
